# AAJA 15: Scrape data from the Internet and get 100 hours of your life back

**Session description:**  
As journalists, we often need information that isn’t easily downloadable. This hands-on session will teach you basic ways to easily save and download data from any URL, without needing to spend hours (or even days) copying and pasting. This technique is most often called “web scraping.” Laptop required.
